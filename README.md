GOTLOGS: This is a stand alone log viewer (text-based files) so no installation is needed. This was initially built to open and watch BigFix agent logs during troubleshooting, but will work for just about anything else.

BFXDIAGS: Same log viewer, but with specific items to troubleshoot the BigFix agent on an endpoint. Auto-checks for port 52311 and the BESClient service.
